# EzMem
A simple implementation of array and string types fairly similar to JS, mainly used to learn about bitwise operators, could be useful.
# UPDATE
Added resize/reserve functions and used them for push/pop/shift/unshift.
Allowing for very fast push when memory has been reserved.
# HYPERCOMPILATION
Started concatenating source files to allow further optimizations on compilation.
